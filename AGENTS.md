# dev-tasks

A set of activity-based instructions and agents for GitHub Copilot and other AI coding agents to run structured, PRD-driven development workflows.

## Core Idea

This system brings structure and clarity to AI-assisted development by:

- Defining scope with Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Breaking requirements into actionable, implementation-ready tasks
- Guiding the AI to tackle one task at a time with checkpoints for review
- Providing specialized **agents** that orchestrate the workflow end-to-end
- Enforcing documentation, branch discipline, and GitHub-as-source-of-truth

## Activity-Based Instructions

Instructions are organized as **composable activities** rather than rigid pipeline steps. Each activity can be invoked independently or chained by an agent.

|Activity|File|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|**init**|`init.instructions.md`|Establish product context and technical guidelines (run once per project)|
|**refine**|`refine.instructions.md`|Clarify scope — lightweight issue refinement or full PRD creation|
|**generate-spec**|`generate-spec.instructions.md`|Transform PRD into a technical specification|
|**generate-stories**|`generate-stories.instructions.md`|Break specification into user stories with built-in coverage validation|
|**publish-github**|`publish-github.instructions.md`|Publish user stories as GitHub Issues via MCP|
|**plan**|`plan.instructions.md`|Convert stories or refined issues into execution-ready task lists|
|**implement**|`implement.instructions.md`|Execute task list with step-gated approval, branching, and PR discipline|

### Domain-Specific Instructions

Technology-specific rules are scoped via `applyTo` frontmatter and auto-applied when editing matching files:

|File|Scope|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|`domain/nextjs-pages-components.instructions.md`|`apps/management-hub/src/**/*.tsx`|Next.js + React conventions|

## Agents

|Agent|File|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|**developer**|`developer.agent.md`|Unified implementation agent — single issues and full PRD features|
|**planner**|`planner.agent.md`|Multi-story orchestration agent — batches independent stories and consolidates one integration PR|
|**technical-writer**|`technical-writer.agent.md`|Autonomous documentation maintenance|
|**housekeeping**|`housekeeping.agent.md`|Lint, type, and test-wiring fixes|
|**github-ops**|`github-ops.agent.md`|GitHub consistency — standardizes issues, PRs, branches, labels, milestones, and comments|

## Workflow Chains

### Full Feature (PRD-Driven)

`init` → `refine` → `generate-spec` → `generate-stories` → `publish-github` → `plan` → `implement`

### Single GitHub Issue

`refine` → `plan` → `implement`

### Parallel Multi-Story Execution

`refine` → `generate-spec` → `generate-stories` → `publish-github` → `plan` → `planner` → `implement`

### Quick Fix (Clear Issue)

`plan` → `implement`

## General Agent Guidelines

All AI coding agents working in this repository **MUST**:

- Always create feature branches — never commit to the default branch
- Use Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, etc.)
- Create PRs for review — never self-merge
- Follow testing, linting, and documentation standards from `technical-guidelines.md`
- Reference GitHub Issues in branch names and commits
